# ðŸš€ Live Coding Challenge
This is a quick coding challenge we designed to assess your qualifications as a potential front-end developer. It's important to note that this is by no means a test. We just want to get a sense of how you write code and solve problems.

## Getting started
To get started with this challenge: 
1) Fork this repository.
2) Create a branch with the name: ``yourlevel-yourname``, example: ``JR-joaosilva``
3) When you finish, make a pull request with name ``yourname``, example ``JoÃ£o Silva`` and add a tag with your level (JR/SR).

## The Challenge
We'll be looking for **simple, well-designed and tested(only SR)** code in the submission.

Please include a ``INSTRUCTIONS.md``:
- Add prints of your application in the repository and use them in the readme
- Setup instructions
- How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution
- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission
- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time

## Details
Use the [SpaceX Graphql API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/) and create a project based on the following wireframe. Use your creativity to choose colors etc...
you can also uset the [SpaceX REST API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)

- TDD (only SR)
- Responsive (Otional for JR / Required for SR)

## Desirable

## Deliverables
We expect this test to take around 5 hours, but not significantly more (your time is very valuable!). We're giving you 4 days from the date you receive it to complete it and send us your repo URL, using **the technology that you decide, of those mentioned in "required"**. Due to this, we ask that you also provide a `INSTRUCTIONS.md` with instructions for running your project, both api and frontend, along with setup instructions (or provide a Dockerfile and a `docker run` instruction).
